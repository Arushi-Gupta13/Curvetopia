# Curvetopia- Adobe GenSolve Hackathon

Curvetopia is a project focused on transforming 2D line art into smooth, regularized curves. Starting with polylines, we convert them into connected sequences of cubic BÃ©zier curves. The goal is to achieve symmetry, completeness, and visual harmony, with outputs in SVG format for easy rendering and visualization



## Background
Curvetopia originated to refine 2D line art, focusing on converting irregular polylines into smooth, aesthetically pleasing curves.
## Installation

To install this project on your local IDE.

### 1. Install Virtual Environment
```bash 
  python -m venv venv
```
### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment
#### For Windows
```bash 
  venv\Scripts\activate
```
### For MacOS/Linux
```bash 
  source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Run Requirements file 
```bash 
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Generate Synthetic DataSet and Predict Classes
```bash 
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python {data_preparation}.py  // add relative path
  python {train}.py  // add relative path
```
### 5. To Regularize Curves
```bash 
  python regularize.py     // Add the relative path to image which is to be regularized. 
```
### 6. To Complete Curves
```bash 
  python complete_curves.py     // Add the relative path to image which is to be regularized. 
```
